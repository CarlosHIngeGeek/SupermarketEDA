# Supermarket Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA

Continuing with the project analyzing mobile phone models that we scraped from a Peruvian supermarket, we will perform preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to begin deriving some insights. For this purpose, we will use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and RapidFuzzy.

## Key Insights
➡️ Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi lead by number of article links with percentages greater than 20%, very far from the following brand Motorola with 9%.<br>
➡️ The battery capacity, not in terms of efficiency but in terms of amperage, shows Apple with lower specifications than Android brands.<br>
➡️ The cost of cell phone models from Google, Apple and Samsung brands is considerably higher than other brands.<br>
➡️ Top Ten models: Apple's iPhone 13 and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Samsung's Galaxy A55 5G and Galaxy A35, Xiaomi's Redmi Note 13 Pro+ and Redmi13C are the smartphone models with the largest number of article links from each of these brands.<br>
➡️ Models with 8GB of RAM and 256GB internal memory respectively are the specifications with the greatest presence in this sample.<br>
➡️ In this sample, Android models have more presence with a number of articles with a percentage greater than 71% and are followed by iOS smartphones with 28%, which is consistent with the fact that Android is a much more massive OS and aligned with the most recent market share studies.<br>
