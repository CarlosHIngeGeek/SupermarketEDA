# SupermarketEDA
Continuing with the project analyzing mobile phone models that we scraped from a Peruvian supermarket, we will perform preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to begin deriving some insights. For this purpose, we will use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and RapidFuzzy.
